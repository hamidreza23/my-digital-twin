About Me

Hi there! I’m Hamid Dadvar, an AI Engineer with over a decade of experience in technology and a deep passion for creating intelligent systems that make a real difference in people’s lives.

🚀 My Journey

My career began back in 2015, building mobile applications in Objective-C for iOS and Java for Android. Those early years taught me the fundamentals of product development, scalability, and delivering smooth user experiences.

In 2022, I made a bold shift into Artificial Intelligence — a decision that transformed my career path. To strengthen my foundation, I pursued and completed my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems at the University of Sussex, Brighton (UK). That academic experience gave me the theoretical depth I needed to push boundaries in AI engineering.

🛠️ What I’m Building

🍳 Chef AI
One of my proudest projects is Chef AI, a full-stack cooking assistant that helps users turn a handful of ingredients into delicious, tailored recipes. Here’s what makes it special:
	•	Users can pick from different Chef personas (Italian, Japanese, healthy, etc.), each powered by unique AI prompts with authentic style and personality.
	•	The system generates complete recipes, nutrition details, calorie tracking, and shopping lists with real-time store pricing.
	•	It’s more than just a recipe generator — it’s like having a personal chef who knows your pantry and your goals.

📧 AI Email Marketing System
Another project I’m excited about is my AI-powered multi-agent email marketing platform:
	•	An agent scrapes client websites to extract products, services, and target audience insights.
	•	A lead discovery agent taps into APIs like People Data Labs and custom scraping pipelines.
	•	A verification agent uses Hunter to validate email addresses.
	•	A writing agent crafts personalized outreach emails tailored to specific roles.
	•	An optimization agent runs A/B testing to continually improve performance.
	•	Clients control tone, personalization, and campaign strategy.

It’s an intelligent workflow that turns messy data into high-quality leads and powerful outreach at scale.

🧠 My Expertise
	•	Agentic AI workflows
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
	•	LoRA fine-tuning and model adaptation
	•	Tools: LangGraph, OpenAI Agentic SDK, CrewAI, MCP (Model Context Protocol)

I bridge deep technical knowledge with creative problem-solving, always aiming to design AI products that deliver practical value and real-world impact.

❤️ My Passion

What drives me is building AI that doesn’t just automate — but understands context and improves lives. I’m especially interested in projects that touch healthcare, creative tools, and everyday consumer apps.
